Write an Apex class MathCalculator that performs arithmetic operations on Integers based on the following methods on the input numbers passed to them as arguments.
•add() – Sums 2 input integer arguments and returns the summation
•multiply() – Multiplies 2 input integer arguments and returns the product

Add a method printOutput() that prints the summation or the product from the add or multiple methods to the Debug Log.

(Hint: Implement add(), multiply() and printOutput() as private static methods invoked by a public instance doMath() method. The doMath() method will be invoked from the Execute Anonymous window)
